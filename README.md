# Statistical-Analysis-Portfolio
This is a collection of school reports/projects and personal projects that showcase what I have learned over the course of preparing for graduate school, as well as what I have covered in my MS Statistics program at San Diego State University.
It is the portfolio of a candidate for the Master's of Science in Statistics at San Diego State University.

It is currently in the process of being populated with projects and assignments, and as of April 13, 2023, it contains writing samples and data for projects from the following courses/Master's requirement fulfillment exercises:

-Bayesian Statistics (San Diego State University)

-Data Analysis Exam (San Diego State University)

-Data Analytics and Business Decisions (Foothill College)

-Foundations of Neuroimaging (San Diego State University)

-Spatiotemporal Modeling and Analysis (San Diego State University)

Feel free to reach out if you have questions about the contents of this portfolio.
